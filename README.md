# mpcc-acados
This repository is an implemetation of [MPCC](https://github.com/alexliniger/MPCC) with Python interface of acados.
It is not currently fully implemented and is not working properly.

## TODO
1. Implement a alternating model between kinematic and dynamic model to avoid singularity due to side slip.
2. Implement a integrator for simulation.
3. Determine the vehicle model parameters as a full-scale car.
4. Determine the proper cost function.
